there are 3 main blocks 1. Data extraction layer it extracts data from service now and fortify. Include small icons or images of service now and fortify and sends information to second layer 2. Second layer is Core Engine of VR Agent. It has Vector DB/ Knowledge Base, LLM (Chat Gpt 4.1 ) and all orchestration process on which task happens when. for instance second layer consumes information from data extraction layer, reviews it and get code snippet with filename and line number got from data extraction layer and grabs code snippet to be fixed from the Gitlab (Second layer). Searches for Solution in Vector DB/ Knowledge Base and passes whole data to LLM to get the Correct Code Change to fix the issue. LLM will decide the actual fix sometime Vector DB/ Knowledge Base reference provides little guidance. Then with solution it interacts with third layer (Gitlab) and applies the code change in correct file and line number and raises the Merge request 3. Gitlab is the third layer so second layer extracts data and also using the solutions from LLM it raises MR in Git lab First three layers must come in vertical format. On botton second layer interacts with UI Chat integrated with LLM where to and fro conversation happens between second and UI layer. On top of second layer add a postgress DB layer where second layer interacts to get meta data information like app name, owner of the gitlab URL etc. Add images of Gitlab, service now, fortify, AI chatBOT (UI), LLM vectorDB/RAG, Orchestration process in second layer. Anything which feels relevent
